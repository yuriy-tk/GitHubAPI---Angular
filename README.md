# GitHubAPI Angular
Overview

Build a small browser based application which uses GitHub's API to show the repositories for a given user. 

Requirements

- If one name is supplied, list the repositories belonging to that user, ordered by the number of stars on their own repos
- If two or more names are supplied, tell us who has the most stars on their own repos
- Add any additional info you think may be useful to see
